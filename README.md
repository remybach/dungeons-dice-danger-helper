![Unit Test Status](https://github.com/remybach/dungeons-dice-danger-helper/actions/workflows/unit-test.yml/badge.svg)

This is a helper app for the game [Dungeons, Dice & Danger](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/349463/dungeons-dice-danger) by Richard Garfield.

It allows multiple users to connect to a shared session where dice can be rolled and options can be presented representing all the different combinations that can be made with these dice. It shows a separate section for whomever can/wants to use the black die as well. You can also highlight certain numbers to get an idea of what other combinations use them.
